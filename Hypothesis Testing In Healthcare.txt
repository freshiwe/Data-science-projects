Hypothesis Testing In Healthcare Using Python

Perform hypothesis tests to determine if the adverse effects of a pharmaceutical drug are significant!

Project Description
Pharmaceutical drugs have become an essential part of our health. Therefore, they need to be safe with little or no adverse effects.

You work with a non-profit that advocates for pharmaceutical drug safety. One of Its tasks is to create reports on drugs independent of the drug manufacturer. You'll conduct several hypothesis tests using Python to determine if the adverse reactions of a hypothetical drug are significant. You'll also check if factors such as age significantly influence the adverse reactions.
